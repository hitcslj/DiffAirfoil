Editable and Controllable Airfoil Generation with DIT



## Resources

I have collected some papers on airfoil design. The [resources are available here](https://github.com/hitcslj/awesome-airfoil-design).

I have created an airfoil editing demo using Gradio. The [demo can be found here](https://github.com/hitcslj/airfoil-demo).

I have also built an airfoil editing baseline using VAE. The [code is available here](https://github.com/hitcslj/Airfoil)
